# Color Detection with IR Sensors

This repository contains code and resources for a color detection system using **infrared (IR) sensors**. The project aims to identify and differentiate colors based on their reflectance properties when exposed to IR light.

## Key Features:
- **IR Sensor Array**: Utilizes an array of IR sensors to capture color information from surfaces.
- **Microcontroller Integration**: The system is designed to work with popular microcontrollers such as **Arduino** or **Raspberry Pi**.
- **RGB LED Feedback**: Provides visual feedback using an **RGB LED** to indicate the detected color.
- **Calibration**: Includes calibration routines to account for variations in sensor readings.

## Usage:
1. Set up the hardware components, including the IR sensors and RGB LED.
2. Upload the provided code to your microcontroller.
3. Place the sensor array near the surface you want to analyze.
4. Observe the LED color change corresponding to the detected color.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and adapt it for your specific applications! üåàüîçü§ñ
